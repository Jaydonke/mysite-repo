# Smart Internal Links System v3.0 - Theme-Agnostic Edition

## Overview
The internal link generation system has been completely refactored to be theme-agnostic, removing all hardcoded keywords and making it adaptable to any website theme.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Removed All Hardcoded Keywords**
- **Previously**: Japanese food terms hardcoded (takoyaki, okonomiyaki, etc.)
- **Now**: All keywords dynamically loaded from configuration files

### 2. **Unified Keyword Sources**
The system now properly integrates both keyword sources:
- `CATEGORY_INFO[].keywords`: Category-specific keywords for content classification
- `ARTICLE_GENERATION_CONFIG.articles[].keywords`: Article-specific SEO keywords

### 3. **Theme-Agnostic Architecture**

#### KeywordExtractor Class (lines 54-233)
- Dynamically loads keywords from config.template.js
- Builds unified keyword dictionary from all sources
- Extracts domain-specific terms from content
- Identifies multi-word compound patterns
- Implements smart caching (1-hour timeout)

#### PhraseBuilder Class (lines 239-493)
- Creates meaningful 2-4 word phrases
- Scores phrases based on relevance
- Avoids stop words at phrase boundaries
- Prioritizes domain-specific terminology
- Works with any theme vocabulary

### 4. **Dynamic Pattern Matching**
- No hardcoded regex patterns
- Patterns built dynamically from configuration
- Compound phrases detected automatically
- Named entity extraction based on theme

### 5. **Improved Stop Words Management**
Comprehensive stop word list including:
- Articles, determiners, prepositions
- Common verbs and adjectives
- Web-specific terms to exclude
- First-person pronouns

## How It Works

### Keyword Loading Process
1. Reads `config.template.js` dynamically
2. Extracts keywords from `CATEGORY_INFO`
3. Extracts keywords from `ARTICLE_GENERATION_CONFIG`
4. Merges all keywords into unified sets
5. Identifies multi-word compound patterns
6. Caches results for performance

### Phrase Extraction Process
1. Cleans content (removes markdown, code blocks)
2. Extracts domain terms using loaded keywords
3. Builds phrases from sentences containing keywords
4. Expands phrases by adding context words
5. Validates phrases (length, stop words)
6. Ranks phrases by relevance score

### Relevance Scoring
Phrases are scored based on:
- Presence of domain keywords (+20-30 points)
- Match with compound patterns (+40 points)
- Optimal phrase length (2-3 words) (+15 points)
- Category alignment (+15 points)
- Penalty for generic phrases (-20 points)

## Configuration Requirements

The system expects the following structure in `config.template.js`:

```javascript
export const CATEGORY_INFO = {
  "category-name": {
    keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "multi word keyword"]
  }
  // ... more categories
};

export const ARTICLE_GENERATION_CONFIG = {
  articles: [
    {
      topic: "Article Title",
      keywords: ["seo keyword", "another keyword"],
      category: "category-name"
    }
    // ... more articles
  ]
};
```

## Testing & Verification

### Test Commands
```bash
# Process single article
node scripts/smart-internal-links.js article <slug> --force

# Process all articles
node scripts/smart-internal-links.js all --force

# Clean all internal links
node scripts/smart-internal-links.js clean-all

# Verify keyword loading
node -e "import { KeywordExtractor } from './scripts/smart-internal-links.js'; const e = new KeywordExtractor(); console.log(await e.loadThemeKeywords());"
```

### Current RWA Theme Keywords
The system now properly loads 163+ keywords related to:
- Tokenization and blockchain technology
- DeFi and Web3 concepts
- Smart contracts and protocols
- Investment and portfolio management
- Legal and compliance terms
- Real estate and commodities
- Security tokens and standards

## Benefits

1. **Theme Flexibility**: Works with any theme without code changes
2. **Maintainability**: All theme data in configuration files
3. **Performance**: Smart caching reduces repeated processing
4. **SEO Optimization**: Better anchor text selection
5. **Scalability**: Easily handles hundreds of keywords
6. **Accuracy**: Context-aware phrase building

## Migration Guide

When changing themes:
1. Update keywords in `CATEGORY_INFO` in config.template.js
2. Update article keywords in `ARTICLE_GENERATION_CONFIG`
3. Run `node scripts/smart-internal-links.js clean-all`
4. Run `node scripts/smart-internal-links.js all --force`

The system will automatically adapt to the new theme vocabulary.
